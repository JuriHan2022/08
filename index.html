    <p>
      hyper employment got me thining about the future of work-market
      esepecially as a designer who is heavly working screen-based only.
      Sometimes I feel that as even a student there is the joy of so many new
      information and methods to design comming out. But at the same time
      immense amount of frustration and stress related to having so much to look
      into. What will be the future of work be? Are all the tiktok millenial
      bloomers truly teaching us to "work hard and play hard" or become the
      "fire-generation"--WHERE YOU WORK FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND HAVE
      LEISURE or are we simply all becomming so greedy that we don't understand
      what actual enjoyment and leisure is?
